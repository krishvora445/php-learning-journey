# Your First PHP Tag

This lesson introduces the syntax for embedding PHP within HTML.

## Key Concepts
- **PHP Tags**: PHP code is enclosed within `<?php` and `?>` tags.
- **Echo Statement**: `echo` is used to output one or more strings to the page.
- **HTML Integration**: PHP can be seamlessly mixed with HTML commands. In `index.php`, PHP is used inside an `<h1>` tag to dynamically generate the heading text.

## Code Example
```php
<?php
echo "Hello World";
?>
```
The above code results in "Hello World" being rendered in the browser.
