 Invoke-WebRequest -Method Post -Uri "http://localhost:8090/notes/create" -Body "body="

 wget --post-data 'body=' http://localhost:8090/notes/create


curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/notes/create -d 'body='

Explanation of the Vulnerability:

The HTML `required` attribute you added to the textarea provides "Client-Side Validation".
- It runs in the user's browser.
- It prevents the *browser* from submitting the form if the field is empty.
- It improves User Experience (UI) by giving instant feedback.

However, as shown by the commands above, this does NOT secure your server.
Specific tools like `curl`, `wget`, or PowerShell's `Invoke-WebRequest` interact directly with your server via HTTP, bypassing the browser entirely. Since they bypass the browser, they also bypass the HTML `required` check.

The Problem:
If you rely only on client-side validation, anyone can send empty or malicious data to your server by using these tools.

The Solution:
You effectively need "Server-Side Validation". You must check the data in your PHP code (controller) before processing it or saving it to the database. Client-side validation is a convenience; Server-side validation is a security requirement.
