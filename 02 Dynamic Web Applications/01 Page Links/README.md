# Episode 12: Page Links

In this episode, we learn how to create a multi-page website by linking separate PHP files.

## Concepts Covered
- Creating multiple pages (`index.php`, `about.php`, `contact.php`).
- Separating logic (PHP) from presentation (HTML views).
- Using anchor tags (`<a href="...">`) to navigate between pages.
- Understanding how the server serves different files based on the URL.

## Folder Structure
- `index.php`, `about.php`, `contact.php`: The controllers/logic for each page.
- `*.view.php`: The HTML templates for each page.
